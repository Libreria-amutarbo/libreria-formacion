# Button

The `dcx-ng-button` component is a UI/UX-agnostic element designed for flexibility and reuse.  
It supports both unstyled and class-based variations. You can pass a label or use content projection via ng-content.

---

## Unstyled Version

Use this version when you want full control over appearance.  
No styles are applied by default. You’re responsible for all visual presentation.

<Canvas of={ButtonUnstyledStories.Unstyled} />

---

## Class-Based Version

The class-based button uses minimal default styles built with BEM naming convention and SCSS.  
It leverages CSS variables for flexibility and can be easily extended.

<Canvas of={ButtonClassBasedStories.Primary} />

You can customize:

- variant: primary, secondary, link, icon
- size: small, medium, large, block
- disabled: disables the button
- icon: optional icon class
- label: button text
