# Divider

The `dcx-ng-divider` component is a layout utility used to visually separate content.  
It supports both unstyled and class-based variations for flexibility and design control.

---

## Unstyled Version

Use this version when you want full control over appearance.  
No styles are applied by default. You are responsible for setting properties such as color, thickness, and orientation.

<Canvas of={DividerUnstyledStories.UnstyledHorizontal} />
<Canvas of={DividerUnstyledStories.UnstyledVertical} />

---

## Class-Based Version

The class-based divider uses minimal default styles built with the BEM naming convention and SCSS.  
It leverages CSS variables for flexibility and can be easily extended or themed.

<Canvas of={DividerClassBasedStories.HorizontalMedium} />
<Canvas of={DividerClassBasedStories.VerticalMedium} />

You can customize:

- **orientation**: horizontal or vertical
- **size**: s, m, l, xl, auto
- **color**: any valid CSS color
- **thickness**: defines how thick the line is
- **ariaLabel**: accessibility text
- **type**: dot or default

## Usage Example

```html
<dcx-ng-divider
  orientation="horizontal"
  size="m"
  color="#0056b3"
  [thickness]="2"
  ariaLabel="Divider"
></dcx-ng-divider>
```
