# Input

The `dcx-ng-input` component is a form utility used to register input from the user.  
It supports both unstyled and class-based variations for flexibility and design control.

---

## Unstyled Version

Use this version when you want full control over appearance.  
No styles are applied by default. You are responsible for setting properties such as color, thickness, and orientation.

---

## Class-Based Version

The class-based input uses minimal default styles built with the BEM naming convention and SCSS.  
It leverages CSS variables for flexibility and can be easily extended or themed.

<Canvas of={InputClassBasedStories.TextSmall} />
<Canvas of={InputClassBasedStories.NumberMedium} />
<Canvas of={InputClassBasedStories.EmailLargeRequired} />

You can customize:

- **type**: text, number, email, password, date, search, tel, url
- **size**: small (s), medium (m), large (l), extra large (xl)
- **placeholder**: any text
- **disabled**: defines if the case is disabled
- **required**: defines if the completion is required
- **label**: name for the case
- **value**: default value

<dcx-ng-input label="tamaño s" placeholder="Escriba algo..." [disabled]="false" [required]="true"
        [type]="'text'" [size]="'s'" (valueChange)="showValue()"></dcx-ng-input>
